# StratoLink

StratoLink is a motorized antenna system designed for reliable communication with low-altitude satellites, operating at a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet. The system aims to establish a strong communication link between the small satellite and a ground station by tracking the satellite's position in real-time and adjusting the orientation of the antenna accordingly.

## Features
- Motorized, two-axis antenna system for ground station communication
- Real-time tracking and antenna adjustment based on satellite position and orientation data
- Compatible with CanSat projects and other low-altitude satellite applications
- Support for various communication protocols, including XBee with SMA connections

##Applications
StratoLink is suitable for various applications, such as:

- Educational projects, including CanSat competitions
- Amateur radio satellite communications
- Remote sensing and data collection from low-altitude satellites
- Ground station communication for weather balloons or high-altitude drone operations
By providing an adaptable and accurate antenna tracking system, StratoLink enables efficient communication with small satellites, ensuring the successful transmission and reception of data throughout their missions.
